# Firebase GraphQL backend


## Getting started

### Introduction 

Welcome!


### What is Express JS?

Express is a minimalist and flexible Web Node.js infrastructure that provides a robust feature set for web and mobile applications. Thanks to a host of HTTP utility methods and middleware available to you, creating a robust API is fast and easy.


### What is Firebase?

Firebase is a set of hosting services for any type of application (Android, iOS, Javascript, Node.js, Java, Unity, PHP, C ++ ...). It offers hosting in NoSQL and in real time databases, content, social authentication (Google, Facebook, Twitter and Github), and notifications, or services, such as for example a server of real time communication. Launched in 2011 under the name of Envolve, by Andrew Lee and by James Templin, the service is bought by Google in October 2014. It belongs today to the parent company of Google: Alphabet. All implementation and server management of Firebase is the sole responsibility of the company Alphabet. Applications that use Firebase integrate a library that allows for various possible interactions.

### Why GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 until its publication in 2015. It offers an alternative to the REST API. It proposes to the client to formulate the data structure in the query, while the same structure is returned by the server. Strongly typed, this language avoids the problems of insufficient data return (supernumerary) or supernumerary (supernumerary). Pairing with firebase allows to fill in the gaps of this one and provide a powerful backend.
